## Log Entries

### **YYYY-MM-DD**

- **Progress:**
  - Implemented the core `AuthenticationService` class.
  - Wrote unit tests for the `generate_jwt` method.
  - Set up the initial controller structure for the `/login` endpoint.

- **Obstacles:**
  - Ran into a dependency issue with the `pyjwt` library version. Resolved by pinning it to `v2.8.0` in `requirements.in`.

- **Key Findings:**
  - The database connection pooling strategy needs to be re-evaluated. The current approach may not be efficient under heavy load. This should be flagged for a future technical debt task.
