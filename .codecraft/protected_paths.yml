# Protected Paths Manifest
# This file lists all files and directories that are considered critical to
# the project's structure, workflow, and configuration.
#
# AI agents and automated scripts are PROHIBITED from modifying, moving, or
# deleting any of these paths without explicit human review and approval.
# The `cli.py` script and future automation tools should use this list as a
# safeguard before performing any file write operations.
