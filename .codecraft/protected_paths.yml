# Protected Paths Configuration
# -----------------------------
# This file lists all files and directories that are critical to the project's
# structure and workflow. The `cli.py delete` command is forbidden from
# deleting any path that matches an entry in this list.
#
# Paths should be relative to the project root.
# You can specify a directory (e.g., "src/") or a specific file.
