# CodeCraftAI
Develop an AI-assisted programming tool that automates code generation, optimizes existing code, and provides real-time debugging suggestions, aiming to improve developers' coding efficiency while ensuring code quality and maintainability.

## AI-Driven Development with SpecKit-Flow

This project is developed using **SpecKit-Flow**, an advanced AI spec-driven framework. This methodology ensures that all development, especially that performed by AI agents, is rigorously planned, specified, and verified before any code is written.

The core of our approach is a deep, structured specification (the "SpecKit") that is managed through a transparent, auditable lifecycle (the "Flow", powered by OpenSpec). This allows for unprecedented clarity, predictability, and quality in the AI development process.

To learn more about our development process, please read the full framework documentation:
